# Time Series Forecasting with Prophet

This project focuses on time series analysis using Facebook's Prophet library to forecast hourly electricity consumption in homes in California.

## Summary

The project involved the following steps:

1. **Data Exploration:** Visualized the hourly electricity consumption data using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
2. **Data Preparation:** Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. **Modeling:** Utilized Facebook's Prophet library to train a forecasting model on the training data.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
5. **Feature Engineering:** Incorporated holiday information into the model to improve forecasting accuracy.
6. **Visualization:** Plotted the forecasted values against the actual values to assess the model's performance visually.
